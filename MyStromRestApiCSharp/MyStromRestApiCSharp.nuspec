			This repository contains objects for the various MyStrom appliances you can buy everywhere.
			The special thing about those appliances is that they each contain a small web-server sporting a REST API.
			So you're not bound to some quirky wireless protocol you need a special dongle for, or such awful stuff. Just
			use standard HTTP calls. That's all.

			The contained device-objects can connect to such a device and send the right commands in order to, for example, turn
			a lamp on or off, as well as periodically query status information, so you may query it at leisure.
			Currently only the MyStrom-Switch and the MyStrom-Bulb-EU are implemented as well as device-lookup and all the
			general stuff. But feel free to request add-ons or just make a pull-request on the repository on GitHub.
			See the REST API documentation here: https://api.mystrom.ch/?version=latest
